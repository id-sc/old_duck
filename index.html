        <p>Multiple software were used for this project. In order to make my design, I used a Computer-Aided Design
          Software called Autodesk Fusion 360. PrusaSlicer helped me do the 3D slicing and I used the PRUSA i3 MK3S+ 
          printer to print my designs. The filament I used is the allPHA Colorfabb which is 100% biobased and 
          biodegradable in any biotype.

        <p>After searching images for each of these ideas, I decided to choose to work on snowflakes since the complexity and the variety of its shape 
          inspired me the most. I started looking for a lot of images of different snowflakes in order to design my own snowflake. Here are a few images
          I took inspiration from.
        </p>
        <div class="images-img">
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122894971/218130469-73e4cc9b-a985-4aff-9610-2810d75a672f.jpeg" alt="img">

        </div>
        <div class="ideation-top">
          <p>From these images, I started sketching a few snowflake designs. I decided to make two of them: one with large borders 
            and one with thinner ones. The two should be able to clip to one another. I was a bit worried material the amout of details
            on each snowflake. They are quite small and might not be visible or even weaken the structure. Here are the sketches I made.

        <h1 class="section-title"><span>First </span>Prints</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="prints-top">
        <p>I first needed to get acquainted with the software and print something not too complicated. I decided to follow 
          an online tutorial (http://romaindivozzo.gitlab.io/teaching/fusion360_101/). This allowed me to see how the designs
          I made on the software would look like once printed. 
        </p>
        <div class="images-img">
          <img src="img/equerre-construction.png" alt="img">
          <img src="img/final-equerre.png" alt="img">
        </div>
        <p>While doing the 3D slicing of the piece, I noticed my design was 2mm thick. I went back to Fusion 360 to change it to 0.6mm
          and sliced the new design.
          However, I forgot to transfer that new file to the SD card and printed the wrong file. This led to a warping problem. By the time
          I realized it was almost the end of the print. I still interrupted the print. Here is how the design turned out.
        </p>
        <div class="images-img">
          <img src="img/equerre-rate.jpg" alt="img">
        </div>
        <div class="prints-top">
          <p>After doing the tutorial, I wanted to try implementing an easy design of my own. I designed two smiley faces and printed them.
            The winking face was printed with a 0.3mm thickness. The end result was a little too thin, I would add 0.1 or 0.2mm for the next prints.
          </p>

          </div>
          <div class="prints-top">
            <p>The heart-eyed emoji (inspired by the upcoming Valentine's Day) was 0.4mm thick which was perfect for this design. However, considering
              the level of details of my snowflake design, I decided that I wanted a 0.5mm thickness for it.

            </div>
          <p>Navigating freely in the software made me discover some useful tools and allowed me to transfer my ideas into 
          the platform with more ease. This helped me get a sense of what I could achieve in the limited amount of time. I 
          now felt ready to try and implement my first snowflake!

      <div class="design-top">
        <p> I now had to transfer my vision from the sketches to the software. I simplified some of the details I had on the drawings
          to make them easier to implement on Fusion. As you will see below, the final designs of the snowflakes are slightly inspired 
          from the flowers, I mentioned before in the ideation section. At some point, my design made the software very slow. Each change 
          would take more than 30 seconds to load if it loaded, otherwise, the app would just crash. I still managed to finish both designs 
          which are the following.
        </p>
        <div class="images-img">
          <img src="img/flocon-epais-fusion.png" alt="img">

          <div class="design-top">
          <p>
            I started by printing snowflakes of multiple sizes: 5.5cm, 8cm, and 9 cm with a 0.5mm thickness. The first layer was 0.2mm thick and the 
            next ones were 0.15mm thick. 
          </p>
          <div class="images-img">
            <img src="img/first-snowflakes.jpg" alt="img">

          </div>
          <p>
            As you can see in the last image, the snowflakes that came out the best were the small ones. Some will argue that the imperfections on the 
            big snowflake makes it visually appealing but regarding the instructions of the project, this makes the structure of the snowflake very weak 
            and hard to clip without breaking. Moreover, I wanted to have big snowflakes so I gave it a few more trials while changing the layers' thickness 
            in PrusaSlicer to 0.3mm and 0.1mm for the first layer and 0.15 for the next layers. 
          </p>
          <div class="images-img">

            <img src="img/change-parameters-thinner.jpg" alt="img">
          </div>
          <p>
            After a few prints -fails- with different parameters, the best fitting parameters were still 0.2mm + 0.15mm which worked only on small snowflakes. 
            I then decided to shrink my design from 9cm to 5.5cm a piece. During each of the failed prints, I also slightly modified the width of the snowflake's 
            slits and branches. These several prints allowed me to test and find the perfect size for them. I now had a working design and could finally launch mass printing! 
            I printed the large border design with a 0.5mm width and the thin border with a 0.6mm width to make it stronger.

            A lot of snowflakes!

            Here are different ways to assemble the snowflakes.

          <img src="img/unusual-clip-2.jpg" alt="img">
        </div>
          <p>If you assemble them the classic way as in the first assembling picture, you can assemble 8 snowflakes, 4 of each type, to make a snowball.
            It is inspired by the shape of a football.
          </p>
          <div class="images-img">
            <img src="img/snowballs.jpg" alt="img">
          </div>
          <p>By assembling them the other way, you get another structure that is flat. By playing with both, you can play
            with volume and cover flat surfaces as well as round surfaces.
